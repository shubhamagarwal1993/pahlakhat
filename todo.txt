// running app
To start the application, we need to run gunicorn which will run the pahlakhat.py file and app.
Go to `/var/www/vhosts/pahlakhat`
and run `gunicorn pahlakhat:app`

// TODO
Should set up supervisor at some point to avoid this
Set up SSL
Close down extra ports open on EC2(60000 - 61000 for mosh)

// nginx conf
running `sudo ln /etc/nginx/sites-available/pahlakhat.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` will set up file in nginx
then test using `nginx -t`
reload nginx using `sudo service nginx reload`
