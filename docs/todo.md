// TODO
Should set up supervisor at some point to avoid this
Close down extra ports open on EC2(60000 - 61000 for mosh)
set up db and viewing from web browser
proper login box and mutiple users (last thing to do - not now. This wil need another resource for users, with POST creating a user and so on)
